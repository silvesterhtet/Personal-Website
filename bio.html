            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Computers and technology have been my passion ever since I had access to my dad's old laptop.
                I loved that I was able to play games, watch videos and learn about anything I wanted.
                <br><br> My introduction to programming came when in the fifth grade, when my Computer Literacy class
                introduced me to Scratch. I was fascinated by the idea that I could create my own games and animations.
                I remember spending countless hours making games, testing them, and sharing them with my friends.
                <br><br> I have come a long way since then, and I am now a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley
                learning how to develop apps, design an OS and hack into vulnerable systems. I am drawn by the challenges and
                opporunities that come with the field and hope to keep doing what I love.

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>Originally entering Berkeley as a Civil Engineer, my love of programming resurfaced when I had to take a few coding classes.
            From then on, I started taking more Computer Science classes and then eventually picked up a major in the field.
            This would be my first recruitment cycle in the tech industry, but I have been preparing for years to perfect my coding skills.

        <h2>Everything ... is still ahead.</h2>
        <p>Despite all the classes I have taken and the projects I created, my journey in the tech industry has only begun.
            I cannot wait to see myself in five years when I am developing softwares that can reach millions of people.
